# These are temporary files generated by Cargo for various purposes
# (e.g., build scripts, test results, etc.)
# If you are using a specific IDE or editor, you might want to add its specific ignore patterns here as well.
# For example, for VS Code:
# .vscode/

# Ignore editor-specific files and directories
# Emacs
*.elc
# Vim
*.swp
*.swo
*.swn
# IntelliJ IDEA
.idea/
# VS Code
.vscode/

# Operating System specific files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Cargo generated files
Cargo.lock
# If you are working on a library and want to commit Cargo.lock,
# you can remove this line. For applications, it's generally good practice to commit it.

# Other potential temporary files or logs
*.log
*.tmp
